Concept of this website: 

ApexArtistry is a fully dynamic and responsive online platform where users can support artists through donations. If a user aspires to be a creative artist, they can submit a request to the admin, who has the authority to elevate a regular user to the status of a creator. Once designated as a creator, individuals can submit their artwork and await the platform's decision on whether they win the contest. Winners receive a prize, while non-winners receive the donated amount after deducting platform charges.
